# Rafail Psyroukis 

My name is Rafail Psyroukis and I am a PhD student at Durham University in the UK. My supervisor is Prof. Thanasis Bouganis.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree (Part III) from the University of Cambridge.

I am mainly interested in the study of L-functions of higher rank modular forms. More specifically, my research interests include the study of Siegel and Hermitian modular forms and of their Fourier-Jacobi coefficients as well as the different kind of connections with modular forms of the orthogonal group.
